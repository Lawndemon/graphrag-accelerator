      <data key="d1">George Washington was the first President of the United States and a key figure in the American Revolutionary War. He was inaugurated in New York City and played a significant role in shaping the early United States. Washington commissioned the Montauk Lighthouse in 1797 and selected the exact location for the federal district, signing the Residence Act into law on July 16, 1790. He also commissioned the design of Washington, D.C., the national capital named in his honor.

Washington's influence extends beyond his presidency; he was the former owner of Mount Vernon and the namesake of the state of Washington, as well as the town of Washington in Sunderland, one of Washington, D.C.'s sister cities. His family coat of arms influenced the design of the Washington, D.C. flag, and his unfinished portrait by Gilbert Stuart inspired the state seal of Washington. Additionally, several ships named USS Washington were honored after him.</data>

It retains the power to overturn local laws in the District of Columbia and must approve the local taxes and budget set by the mayor and council. Congress also provides additional grants for federal programs and imposes prohibitions such as the commuter tax ban affecting the district's budget.

Historically, Congress has played a pivotal role in shaping the governance and development of Washington, D.C. It passed the Residence Act on July 9, 1790, approving the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River. Congress held its first session in Washington, D.C., on November 17, 1800. In 1871, it passed the Organic Act, which replaced the territorial government of the District of Columbia with a three-member board of commissioners in 1874.

Congress has exclusive jurisdiction over Washington, D.C., and retains the right to review and overturn laws created by the local council. It also ended the district residents' representation after the passage of a specific Act.

      <data key="d0">"GEO"</data>
      <data key="d1">New York City, often referred to as NYC, is the largest and most populous city in the United States, with an estimated record high population of 8,622,698 in 2017. Located in the southeastern part of New York State, within the Downstate region, it comprises five boroughs: Bronx, New York County (Manhattan), Queens, Kings County (Brooklyn), and Richmond County (Staten Island). These boroughs are coterminous with five counties and are situated at the mouth of the Hudson River, with four of them located on three islands.

NYC is a global epicenter for culture, finance, and media, often described as the world's most important city and the capital of the world. It is the largest global center for trading in public equity and debt capital markets, private equity, and mergers and acquisitions, and serves as the principal commercial banking center of the United States. The city is also a major hub for high technology industries, benefiting from its position at the terminus of several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines and its growing outdoor wireless connectivity.

The city has a strong competitive advantage in creative industries, including new media, digital media, film and television production, advertising, fashion, design, and architecture. It is home to the City University of New York (CUNY) and has been the largest port of entry for legal immigration into the United States since the early 19th century. NYC is also a major port city connected to the Great Lakes by the Erie Canal, playing a crucial role in commerce and migration.

New York City is known for its diverse population and neighborhoods such as Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant. It is the most linguistically diverse city in the world and home to one of the world's largest LGBTQ populations, serving as the central node of the LGBTQ+ sociopolitical ecosystem. The city is a significant Democratic stronghold with liberal politics and is the most important source of political fundraising in the United States for both major parties.

Historically, NYC served as the national capital under the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution until 1790 and was the site of the inauguration of President George Washington. It was also a temporary location for the Continental Congress from January 1785 to March 1789 and was occupied by the British during the American Revolutionary War, serving as their military and political base of operations in North America.

The city has faced significant challenges, including being a major city affected by Hurricane Sandy,</data>

      <data key="d1">World War II was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945, involving most of the world's nations, including the United States. During this period, the islands of Attu and Kiska were occupied by Japanese forces as part of the Aleutian Islands Campaign. The war significantly impacted various regions and industries in the United States.

In California, the conflict led to substantial economic expansion due to the strong presence of aerospace and defense industries. The state manufactured 9% of U.S. armaments and ranked first in military ship production. Major contributions came from companies like Boeing and various ports, making California a focal point for war industries.

The war also had significant social impacts. It led to an expansion of federal employees in certain cities, which in turn affected local populations. Wartime industries and the U.S. Armed Forces employed and recruited tens of thousands of African Americans, prompting significant migration to the West Coast. Additionally, after the war, the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs initiated relocation programs for Native Americans.

Overall, World War II was a transformative period that reshaped economies, industries, and demographics across the United States.</data>

      <data key="d1">Mexico is a country in North America that has a significant impact on various regions in the United States. It is California's biggest trade partner, playing a crucial role in the state's economy through international commerce. Historically, Mexico gained control of California in 1821 following its successful war for independence from Spain, and California was part of Mexico before becoming part of the United States. Despite a recent decrease in immigration from Mexico to California, more than half of the illegal immigrants in California originate from Mexico.

Mexico is also a major source of immigrants living in Washington, D.C., and one of the leading out-of-state birthplaces for residents in New York. In 2018, Mexico was one of the top countries of origin for immigrants to both New York and Alaska. The early government of Mexico was highly unstable, which has influenced its historical and contemporary relationship with the United States.</data>

It is ranked among the top 20 most liberal American cities and has adopted sanctuary policies for illegal immigrants. The city experienced a dramatic population increase from 500 to 150,000 between 1847 and 1870. In 1862, legislative sessions were held in San Francisco due to flooding in Sacramento. San Francisco is also notable for being near the landing site of Francis Drake during his exploration in 1579.

San Francisco is a consolidated city-county, meaning that both the city and county governments have been merged into one unified jurisdiction. The city grew out of Mission San Francisco de As&#237;s and is characterized by its cool shoreline temperatures in summer due to maritime moderation. Despite its prominence, San Francisco was excluded from a list of cities where celebrity chefs have opened restaurants.</data>

      <data key="d1">Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America, known for its diverse terrain of open spaces, mountains, forests, and abundant wildlife. It is the largest U.S. state by area and the third-least populous, with a population of 736,081 as of 2020. Alaska borders the Canadian territory of Yukon and the province of British Columbia to the east, and shares a maritime border with Russia's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in the Bering Strait. The Chukchi and Beaufort Seas of the Arctic Ocean lie to the north, and the Pacific Ocean lies to the south. It is considered the northernmost, westernmost, and easternmost state in the United States.

Alaska was admitted as the 49th state in 1959 and is governed as a republic with three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. It has a unique administrative structure, including boroughs and the Unorganized Borough, and is known for its libertarian-leaning political culture. The state has implemented non-partisan blanket primaries and ranked-choice voting for statewide elections, making it the third state with jungle primaries and the second with ranked-choice voting.

The state's economy is diverse, dominated by the oil and gas industry, significant military presence, and notable seafood exports. Alaska experienced an economic boom due to oil production and later developed tourism as a significant source of revenue. It primarily finances its government operations through petroleum revenues and federal subsidies, resulting in the lowest individual tax burden in the United States. The state also has high per capita personal income and a substantial number of millionaires per capita.

Alaska is known for its extreme climate variations, including the highest and lowest recorded temperatures in the state. It has diverse climates, ranging from subarctic to oceanic, with significant variations in precipitation and temperature across different regions. The state has a short growing season, which limits the types of crops that can be grown, but it has notable agricultural areas such as the Matanuska Valley, Kenai Peninsula, and Tanana Valley. Alaska is also known for its unique agricultural practices, including market gardening, small farms, and farmers' markets, as well as a significant peony industry and an abundance of seafood.

The state has a significant Indigenous population and a rich history of indigenous peoples, with 5.2% of the population speaking one of the state's 20 indigenous languages. Alaska was named during the Russian colonial</data>

The United States is notable for its involvement in various historical events and territorial expansions. For instance, it gained control of California in 1848 after the Mexican-American War and following the Bear Flag Revolt. John Marsh was one of the individuals who wanted California to become part of the United States. Additionally, the country was involved in territorial negotiations and disputes with Great Britain over the Pacific Northwest, including the joint military occupation of the San Juan Islands during the Pig War, which was resolved in favor of the United States by Kaiser Wilhelm I's arbitration ruling.

The United States also played a significant role in the Oregon Boundary Dispute, sharing joint occupancy of the Oregon Country with Britain. The country is home to Alaska, a semi-exclave and the largest exclave in the world. New York City, a major metropolis within the United States, is significant both historically and in contemporary contexts. It was mentioned in the context of federal jurisdiction over immigration established in 1890 and was a major hotspot for COVID-19 cases as of March 2020.

The United States is also recognized for its cultural and historical landmarks, such as the Statue of Liberty, which was a gift from France, and its numerous national parks and monuments. The country has experienced shifting immigration patterns over the years and is noted for having the state with the fastest-growing economy.</data>

Culturally, California is a melting pot with significant influences from Hispanic Californio, Mexican, Latin American, and Asian cultures. It has a diverse population, including the largest Hispanic ethnic group and significant communities from Mexico, the Philippines, China, India, and Vietnam. The state is also known for its linguistic diversity, with more than 70 indigenous languages and a significant number of Chinese, Vietnamese, and Punjabi speakers. English is the official language, with Spanish being the most commonly spoken language after English.

California has a rich history, having been a region in pre-Columbian North America with at least 300,000 people living there prior to European colonization. It was added to a map by 1541, presumably by a Spanish navigator, and experienced significant changes following Mexican independence. The state was acquired by the United States following the Bear Flag Revolt and the Mexican-American War and became a free state on September 9, 1850. It played a role in the American Civil War by sending gold shipments to support the Union.

The state has experienced various political and social changes, including disputes over water rights, tax revol</data>

      <data key="d1">Anchorage is the most populous city in Alaska, home to 291,247 people as of 2020, with approximately half of the state's residents living within its metropolitan area. Located in the South Central region of the state, Anchorage is known for its milder climate by Alaskan standards due to its proximity to the seacoast, receiving 16 inches (41 cm) of precipitation and around 75 inches (190 cm) of snow annually. The city is situated near Turnagain Arm, which is famous for having one of the world's largest tides, and serves as a reference point for the locations of the Matanuska Valley and Kenai Peninsula.

Anchorage plays a significant role in Alaska's economy and transportation, being served by many major airlines and the Alaska Railroad. The Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport has recently undergone extensive remodeling and construction. The city also hosts several hospitals, including Providence Alaska Medical Center, Alaska Regional Hospital, and Alaska Native Medical Center.

The city has a rich cultural and social landscape, with many reality television shows filmed there and various sporting venues, teams, and events based in the area. Anchorage is also home to the majority of Alaskan Hindus and Muslims, with the Islamic Community Center of Anchorage and the state's first mosque located within the city. Politically, Midtown and Downtown Anchorage are strongholds of the Democratic Party, while South Anchorage typically shows strong Republican support.

Anchorage has a significant historical background, particularly noted for the Good Friday Earthquake, which caused extensive damage to inadequately earthquake-engineered houses, buildings, and infrastructure. The city's location was cited as a factor in potentially sparing thousands of lives. The earthquake prompted a coordinated response involving the U.S. Army and other organizations, with a team of scientists appointed to assess the damage.

Additionally, Anchorage is a hub for education, housing one of the AVTEC campuses and the University of Alaska Anchorage. The city is also the starting point of the famous Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. Anchorage's economy benefits from significant military bases and the gravel it receives from the Matanuska Valley. The city merged its government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage.</data>

      <data key="d1">The Central Valley is a large, flat valley that dominates the central portion of California. It is divided into northern and southern halves by the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. This fertile agricultural area is known for its significant contributions to California's agriculture, where crops such as Fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive. The region also contains the state's crude oil and natural gas deposits.

The Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate, characterized by greater temperature extremes than the coastal areas. It receives water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta through an extensive network of pumps and canals, which is crucial for its agricultural productivity.

Despite its agricultural wealth, the Central Valley is one of the most impoverished regions in California. Many migrant farm workers in the area earn less than minimum wage, highlighting the economic disparities within the region.</data>

      <data key="d1">New York, also known as New York State, is a state in the Northeastern United States, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean, New England, Canada, and the Great Lakes. It is one of the original Thirteen Colonies that formed the United States and played a significant role in the early history of the nation, including the American Revolutionary War. New York was the 11th state to ratify the United States Constitution.

Historically, New York was recaptured by the Dutch in 1673 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War and renamed New Orange, before being returned to the English under the Treaty of Westminster. It was a significant colony during the American Revolutionary War, initially not voting for independence but later endorsing the Declaration of Independence. A third of the battles of the war, including the Battle of Long Island, took place in New York.

Geographically, New York covers a total area of 54,555 square miles (141,300 km&#178;), making it the 27th-largest U.S. state by area. The state features diverse landscapes, including urban areas, meadows, forests, rivers, farms, mountains, and lakes. It has a complex terrain and extensive transportation infrastructure, managed by entities such as the NYSDOT, NYSDMV, and PANYNJ.

New York is known for its vibrant economy, diverse exports, large manufacturing sector, and significant grape and wine production. It has a high volume of residents and tourists, and it became the first state to take in over $2 billion in sports bets in a single month. The state is also a major recipient of immigrants from Africa and has a significant population of established Blacks and African Americans migrating to the southern United States.

As of 2024, New York is the fourth-most populous state in the U.S., with a population of 20,215,751 as of the 2020 census. The New York metropolitan area, Buffalo&#8211;Niagara Falls metropolitan area, Saratoga County, and Capital District have seen significant population growth, while areas like Rochester and Syracuse have experienced stagnation or decline. The state is divided into 62 counties, with a significant portion of its population residing in New York City.

New York has a diverse population, including significant Jewish, Asian American, Black or African American, Italian American, Greek American, Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Jamaican American communities.

It is the nation's most populous island, with a census-estimated 7,838,722 residents in 2015, representing 39.6% of the state's population. The island includes the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens at its western end, as well as Nassau County and Suffolk County, which are home to several notable locations such as Montauk Point State Park, Hither Hills State Park, and Belmont Park.

Long Island has a rich history and cultural diversity, with significant populations of Indian and Korean Americans, particularly in areas known as Little Indias and Koreatown. The region was historically divided between the Algonquian Wampanoag and Lenape peoples. It has also been a prominent area for STEM-based education and technology, with contributions from biotechnology companies and scientific research facilities, including the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University and Kings Point.

The island has a humid subtropical climate, characterized by hot summers and cold, damp winters. It is known for its Atlantic coastal pine barrens and forests in the lower Hudson Valley and western Long Island. Long Island also has a moderately sized saltwater commercial fishery, with notable catches such as clams, lobsters, squid, and flounder, and it consumes a significant portion of the state's electrical energy.

Politically, Long Island was solidly Republican until the 1990s but has since shifted to primarily supporting the Democratic Party. The region has also seen proposals to become a separate state, excluding New York City.

Long Island has faced significant natural challenges, notably being heavily impacted by Hurricane Sandy, which caused severe flooding, high winds, and power outages. Historically, it is believed that the explorer Verrazzano may have landed on Long Island during his exploration.

Overall, Long Island is a vibrant and diverse region with a significant population, rich history, and a strong presence in education, technology, and commercial fishing.</data>

      <data key="d0">"GEO"</data>
      <data key="d1">The State of New York is a U.S. state located in the northeastern United States, known for its diverse landscapes and significant water boundaries. It is governed by the New York State Constitution and composed of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The state is well represented in the National Park System with 22 national parks, 4 national heritage areas, 27 national natural landmarks, 262 national historic landmarks, and 5,379 listings on the National Register of Historic Places.

New York is notable for its agricultural production, including products like maple syrup, apples, cherries, cabbage, dairy products, onions, and potatoes. It is the largest producer of cabbage in the U.S. and has significant agricultural activities. The state also offers significant tax incentives for filmmaking and post-film production work, including a tax rebate of up to $420 million annually and an augmented tax credit for post-film production work in Upstate New York, which attracts higher-wage employment in these sectors.

In December 2014, the State of New York announced a $50 million venture-capital fund to encourage enterprises working in biotechnology and advanced materials. Additionally, the state claimed jurisdiction over the original 3.3-acre portion of Ellis Island, a claim upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1998.

The State of New York is home to numerous postgraduate-level schools and public university systems, contributing to its diverse demographics and significant population statistics. In the 2013 fiscal year, the state received 91 cents in services for every $1 it sent in taxes to the federal government. In June 2017, New York announced plans for the first monument to LGBT individuals, highlighting its commitment to diversity and inclusion.</data>

As of 2020, Alaska has a larger population compared to Wyoming and is less densely populated. This means that while Alaska has more residents, its vast land area results in fewer people per square mile. In contrast, Wyoming, despite having a smaller population, is recognized for its 'business friendly' tax policy, as highlighted by the Tax Foundation in 2014. This tax policy makes Wyoming more attractive for businesses compared to Alaska.</data>
